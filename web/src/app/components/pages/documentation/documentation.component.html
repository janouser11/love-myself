            Our installation was located right outside of the library. Each day we asked people to respond to a different prompt. We
            handed out our own personal merchandise as well as items from the organizations that we partnered with. Each
            day we reached over 100 people, several of whom returned each day. We handed out an assortment of deliverables
            given to us by our partners as well as our own personal merchandise.
