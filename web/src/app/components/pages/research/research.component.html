            When the four of us sat down together our main goal was to come up with a topic that interested us all. A common theme among
            the things we talked about was self-love. Self-love is important to value yourself, have healthy boundaries with
            others, accept your personal failures and disappointments, be an advocate for yourself, and express who you are.
            Our intention from the start was to do an on campus intervention in the form of a collabrative art installation.
            Our traget audience was anyone who encountered our project, but mostly VCU students.
            <br>
            <br>In our world today people are increasingly hard on themselves. In college it is easy to get wrapped up in work
            and people quickly forget to take time for themselves and relax. Our goal was to bring awareness to this, we
            wanted to make people stop and think about the good things in their life and even think into their future goals.
            We wanted it to be a repetitive action, something that gained more and more momentum over a series of days. Especially
            because a self-love centered mindset takes time to create.

            Japanese art of fixing broken vessels with a special lacquer that is then dusted with gold, silver or platinum. The practice
            is related to the japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, which calls for seeing beauty in the flawed or imperfect.
            Imperfect but valuable, priceless, beautiful, worthy. This practice dates back to the 15th century. According
            to legend, the craft was created when Japanese shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent his cracked chawan, tea bowl, back
            to China to undergo repairs. When it was returned to him, Yoshimasa was displeased to see that it was mended
            with unsightly metal staples. This encouraged craftsmen to find an alternative, a more aesthetically pleasing
            method of repair.
            <br>
            <br>There are 3 predominant styles of Kintsugi.

        <b>Idea: Flower Pots</b>
        <br>
        <br>Getting a bag of small flower pots from lowes and breaking them then gluing/epoxying them back together and dusting
        the glued part with metallic powder and giving out flower seed packets.
        <br>
        <br>Perhaps doing a multiple day interaction on campus. Have people break the pots, then we repair them, and have people
        come back and decorate them and take them home with plants. Use this to make a comment on how our imperfections are
        what make us beautiful.

      <p>
        The July 7th people all over Japan celebrate Tanabata, the Star Festival. It is celebrated to commemorate the romantic story
        of two lovers represented by the stars Vega and Altair who are only allowed to meet each other once a year as long
        as the skies are clear. It is celebrated on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month, which is July 7th.
        <br>
        <br>On Tanabata people write wishes (sometimes in the form of poetry) on small pieces of paper called tanzaku and hang
        them on bamboo trees. That night or the following day the trees are floated on a river and burned as an offering.

        <b>Idea: The Giving Tree</b>
        <br>
        <br>Bring a fake tree that participants can use to leave compliments to themselves or others. Hang these complements
        on the tree as a gift of self love to any passerby who needs a pick me up, the gift that keeps on giving. This would
        be a tree that people could add on to and take from as well. Would either last all day or for a small amount of time
        over several days. This could also be done several times as a sort of campaign (once a month, once every few weeks,
        etc.)

        <br>
        <b>Idea: The Garden of Words</b>
        <br>
        <br>A 5 day long intervention with two collabrative installations that have daily topic based prompts. In one location
        there would be a fence that people would continually tie on messages to, in another location there would be a mirror
        (this would mostly be used as advertising for the collabrative fence installation).
        <br>
        <br>The goal is to bring awareness and redirection to relevant campus services for people and to bring importance to
        the awareness of self-love. We would do this by breaking up people’s daily routine with activities that support the
        idea of self love. We would encourage people to take a break from their daily habits and use that time to reflect
        on themselves and where they are in life.
