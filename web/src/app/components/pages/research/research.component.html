      <p>
        When the four of us sat down together our main goal was to come up with a topic that interested us all. A common theme among
        the things we talked about was self-love. Self-love is important to value yourself, have healthy boundaries with
        others, accept your personal failures and disappointments, be an advocate for yourself, and express who you are.
        Our intention from the start was to do an on campus intervention in the form of a collabrative art installation.
        Our traget audience was anyone who encountered our project, but mostly VCU students.
        <br>
        <br>In our world today people are increasingly hard on themselves. In college it is easy to get wrapped up in work and
        people quickly forget to take time for themselves and relax. Our goal was to bring awareness to this, we wanted to
        make people stop and think about the good things in their life and even think into their future goals. We wanted
        it to be a repetitive action, something that gained more and more momentum over a series of days. Especially because
        a self-love centered mindset takes time to create.

        Japanese art of fixing broken vessels with a special lacquer that is then dusted with gold, silver or platinum. The practice
        is related to the japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, which calls for seeing beauty in the flawed or imperfect. Imperfect
        but valuable, priceless, beautiful, worthy. This practice dates back to the 15th century. According to legend, the
        craft was created when Japanese shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent his cracked chawan, tea bowl, back to China to undergo
        repairs. When it was returned to him, Yoshimasa was displeased to see that it was mended with unsightly metal staples.
        This encouraged craftsmen to find an alternative, a more aesthetically pleasing method of repair.
        <br>
        <br>There are 3 predominant styles of Kintsugi.
