        Humans have over 70,000 thoughts a day and between 70 and 80% of those thoughts are negative. Students who place their self-worth
        on internal habits like moral values are less stressed and tend to perform better academically. Self-compassion can
        also reduce the stress that causes us to procrastinate. Self-affirmation has been shown to increase problem solving
        skills when weâ€™re stressed.

        The Love Myself Project hopes to raise awareness for and encourage individuals to love themselves. Self-hate and self-depreciation
        is rampant in online communities; young people are struggling with a sense of self-worth. LMP aims to change that
        through a brief but impactful week long engagement on the Virginia Commonwealth University campus, showing love and
        giving hope.
