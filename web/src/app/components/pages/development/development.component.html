            We wanted to have an installation in the same location, with different objects and prompts each day. Originially we wanted
            to hand out buttons, candies, magnets, flowers, cards, etc. The follow lists our preliminary thoughts and ideas
            for the project. A lot of the beginning stages for this project was spent in meetings with potential partners.
            Their collaboration would determine some of the things that we could include in the installation.
