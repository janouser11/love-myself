              These are a few of the originial logo ideations that we went through. We were not completely sure on how to best brand ourselves.
              We didn't want to be gender specific. Our first ideas involved someone hugging themselves although once we
              saw it we realized that it was very hard to break that image away from a "yoga" type of branding so we tried
              to abstract the idea a bit more. We played around solely with the idea of a hug and eventually landed on a
              logo of someone hugging a heart.
              <br>
              <br>Naming ourselves provided another challenge. We wanted it to be specific but not too specific and it needed
              to be easily remembered and recognizable. We took inspiration from the projects that we had studied and realized
              that they were usually several words that provided a very brief description of the project. Since our project
              was about self love we landed on the Love Myself Project. Pair the name and logo with a pastel color palette
              and our soft and welcoming organization was well on its way. These logos appeared on all of the merch that
              we handed out.

            Originally we wanted to have an art installation that just dealt with the topic of body image and loving yourself. A big
            part of loving yourself is accepting who you are and being comfortable in your own skin. The media today has
            set a standard for unhealthy and even unobtainable standards about beauty. The Dove Self Esteem project has done
            many unique projects inspired by this very same topic. We thought that it would be highly relevant and beneficial
            to bring something like that to our campus. The idea was to set up a mirror in a high traffic area on campus.
            We wanted to provide people with an opportunity to see themselves in the mirrior and write something positive
            or encouraging about themselves or other people. We hoped that this to build up over the week and that it would
            be something that people wanted to participate in.

              To create daily interest over the week, we wanted to have elements that remained everyday and elements that changed everyday.
              One of the ideas that we discussed was having a large board where we could post and change content relevant
              to each day’s theme and topics that we wanted to discuss. The idea was to set this up in a high traffic area
              for extended periods of time so that people would begin to recognize it and interact with it.
              <br>
              <br>We did not see this as the most impactful way in which we could present this topic therefore we stepped away
              from this idea early on. However, we did like the idea of having relevant content to give out each day so we
              pulled that into our final idea.

            This was our final concept. A week long intervention on our school's campus that increased awareness to the importance of
            self love. We asked participants to answer questions about themselves and their attitudes about themselves and
            others. We encouraged people to see their own beauty and worth and to seek help should they feel like they needed
            it. Neglecting your own appreciation of yourself can be a dangerous road to go down and our hope is that we helped
            to plant the seed of more positive thinking on our campus.
            <br>
            <br>The time of our collabrative installation was scheduled just a few weeks prior to finals. This is a time when
            students are beginning to stress themselves and test their own capabilities. Many studies have found that students
            will stay up extremely late and then wake up early just so that they can study. This is an extremely unhealthy
            behavior. Our hope is that we reminded people that it is okay to relax. It's okay to take ten minutes, or the
            night to yourself. Your mental stability is the most important thing and many studies have found that we function
            better and think more clearly when our minds are well rested and relaxed.

            This is a combination of diagrams that we created when planning out our final concept. We planned out the topics of each
            day more in-depth and tried to quickly decide how we would present this topics. We landed on having an installation
            in front of the VCU Cabell library that would invite people passing by to participate as well as taking one of
            our free handouts for the day. Our focus became more on lifting up people's spirits in that specific day and
            reminding them that they can push through whatever they are going through.
